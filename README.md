# Full-Stack Application with CRUD Functionality

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It integrates a React frontend with a Node.js and Express backend, and connects to a MongoDB Atlas database for data persistence. The application demonstrates modern web development practices, including RESTful APIs, responsive UI components, and robust error handling.

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - Built using React with a focus on component reusability and maintainability.
  - Implements routing for seamless navigation.
  - Data fetching is powered by REST APIs.
  - Improved error handling for a smooth user experience.

- **Backend:**
  - Powered by Node.js and Express.
  - RESTful API endpoints to manage posts and data operations.
  - Database connection established with MongoDB Atlas.
  - Fully functional CRUD operations for managing resources.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Comprehensive error handling in both frontend and backend to ensure application stability.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - REST API
  - CSS/Styled Components (optional)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB Atlas

- **Additional Tools:**
  - Axios (replaced by REST API calls)
  - npm for dependency management

## Installation and Setup

1. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure MongoDB Atlas connection:

   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory.
   - Add the following:

     ```env
     MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String>
     PORT=5000
     ```

3. Run the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
